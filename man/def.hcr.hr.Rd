Define harvest control rule
}
\details{
This function allows to define harvest control rules (HCRs) which can be incorporated into a
management strategy evaluation framework (DLMtool package). HCRs are saved with a
generic name to the global environment and the names of the HCRs are returned if results of the
function are assigned to an object. HCR runs a SPiCT assessment using catch and
relative biomass index observations. Stock status estimates are used to set the TAC
for the next year. TAC can be based on the distribution of predicted catches (percentileC)
and/or the distribution of the Fmsy reference level (percentileFmsy).
Additionally, a cap can be applied to account for low biomass levels (below Bmsy).
Arguments of returned function are 'x' - the position in a data-limited mehods data object,
'Data' - the data-limited methods data object (see DLMtool), and 'reps' - the number of
stochastic samples of the TAC recommendation (not used for this HCR).
One or several arguments of the function can be provided as vectors to generate several
HCRs at once (several vectors have to have same length).
